# permutateBitBadge

A script for generating every permutation of SilentMode's Bit Badge for a defined list of colours.

This project follows [mode-dotperms](https://github.com/legendarydrew/mode-dotperms): a similar project involving LEGO
DOTS.

## TODOs

- accepting command line arguments:
    - an option to just display the permutation count.
    - configuring how many images to include in a contact sheet.
    - configuring which base to use.
    - configuring colours.
    - configuring the title.
    - an option to render a demo image (for checking the configuration).
    - optionally delete existing generated content.
- generating a video of permutations (รก la [mode-dotperms](https://github.com/legendarydrew/mode-dotperms)).

## A "sadistic" mathematical challenge
How many individual cells would you have to produce for each colour, if you were going to physically create every single permutation?
